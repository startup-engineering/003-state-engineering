# The Network State

## Summary

The network state is a social network with a recognized founder, an integrated cryptocurrency, a definite purpose, a sense of national consciousness, and a plan to crowdfund territory. The state formation process begins with a founding influencer, who organizes the online community that eventually buys land in the physical world. Crucially, that land is not necessarily contiguous. In fact, by default, itâ€™s distributed all over the world.
